# Official Website Design Plan — Bentonite Cat Litter Factory

## 1. Goals & Design Principles

**Primary Goal:** Launch a global B2B export website that empowers visitors to make confident purchasing decisions independently while funnelling high-intent users toward quote, sample, and order inquiries.

**Core Principles**

- **Clarity of value:** The hero must instantly communicate the problem we solve, whom we serve, and our differentiators, following the clarity standards championed by trajectorywebdesign.com.
- **Layered presentation:** Provide concise guidance on the home page and route visitors into deeper second-level content to avoid information overload.
- **Product vs. service focus:** Present standardized product specs on product pages while emphasizing processes, engagement models, and timelines on service-oriented pages.
- **Trust building:** Showcase authentic photography, measurable performance data, and compliance documentation to build credibility without jargon.
- **Clear user paths:** Design tailored flows for distributors, OEM clients, bulk buyers, and compliance teams, supporting both self-service research and immediate contact.
- **Mobile & multilingual:** Deliver a responsive English-first experience with a reserved language switcher for future localization.

## 2. Top-Level Navigation & Site Architecture

The primary navigation contains seven menu items, complemented by persistent right-side CTAs—**Get a Quote** and **Request Samples**.

| Nav Item | Objective | Key Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Products** | Serve ready-to-sell pack buyers | Detailed line-up with specs, scents, granules, packaging, container loading, and tiered pricing logic. |
| **OEM Solutions** | Support private-label clients | Explain OEM-Lite vs. OEM-Full models, processes, timelines, costs, and acceptance standards. |
| **Bulk Supply** | Engage bulk buyers/repackers | Highlight index windows, moisture-proof packaging, QC, and long-term supply programs. |
| **Compliance** | Assist procurement & compliance staff | Provide SDS/TDS, testing summaries, QC flowchart, and regulatory notes (download or request). |
| **Resources** | Aid researchers & prospects | Centralize guides, templates, compliance checklists, and industry reports for SEO and lead capture. |
| **About** | Build trust | Present mine and factory profile, capacity, team, history, and sustainability initiatives. |
| **Contact** | Start conversations & RFQs | Offer segmented forms (Quick Quote, Standard Inquiry, OEM Project) plus phone, email, and live chat options. |

**Additional Landing Page:** Maintain `/wholesale` to capture “wholesale cat litter” demand. Cover SKU tiered pricing, replenishment SLAs, and mixed-container rules, then route to the Products page with in-stock filters.
